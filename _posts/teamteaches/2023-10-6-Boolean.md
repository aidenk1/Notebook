# Booleans and Conditionals

## Booleans

- Booleans represent two values: True and False.
- Example: `my hair color is black: True`

## Relational Operators

- Equal to: `a = b`
- Not equal to: `a != b`
- Greater than: `a > b`
- Less than: `a < b`
- Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`
- Less than or equal to: `a <= b`

## Not Operator

- The `not` operator flips the condition.

## And Operator

- The `and` operator combines two conditions.

## Or Operator

- The `or` operator returns True if at least one condition is true.

## Conditionals

- Condition statements are fundamental in programming and logic.
- They control the program's flow based on certain conditions or criteria.
- A condition statement typically has three parts:
  1. Condition: A Boolean expression or logical test.
  2. True Block: Code executed when the condition is true.
  3. False Block (optional): Code executed when the condition is false.

## Example

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")  # True block
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")  # False block
