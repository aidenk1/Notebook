### Test Corrections:
- Question 4:  
![](https://files.catbox.moe/40yc2h.png)
> Explaination for the incorrect and correct answer:  
I should have read all answer choices more clearly before selecting my answer because I rushed myself at the beginning to pace myself to finish the quiz in time. I know the Internet is a global network that consists of many computers and electronic devices and the WWW is a system of webpages that the public can access.
- Question 12:

> Explaination:  
For the answer I chose, when there is an open space to the left of the robot, it will rotate left and move forward. Since there is no open space to the left initially, the robot will be stuck in an infinite loop and never move. For the correct answer choice C, the robot will move forward, but when there is an open space to the left, it will rotate left, otherwise it will just move forward.
- Question 36:

> Explaination:  
The answer I chose is incorrect because a large number of devices cna contain the information through redistribution by social media posts, emails, and more. Answer D is correct because information that is online in places such as social media can be easily and quickly collected and distributed.
- Question 48:

> Explaination:  
I got this question incorrect because I didn't know what a rogue access point was. Answer A is correct because a rogue access point is a wireless access point that is plugged into a network that the security does not know exists. This allows the unauthorized individual to intercept, analyze, and modify data.
- Question 50:

> Explaination:  
I got this answer incorrect because I did not know what symmetric encryption was. After doing some research and googling, I now know why answer A is correct. Symmetric encryption uses a singular key for both encryption and decryption and since the key can unlock data, it should be kept secret.
- Question 55:

> Explaination:  
I orignally selected the correct answer but then double guessed myself and chose the wrong answer. If I was more familiar with CB psuedo code, I would have been able to answer this question with more confidence and quicker. The difference between answer A and C is although both answers assign the last element of the list to temp, Answer C inserts temp as the first element of the list while Answer A adds temp to the end of the list.
- Question 66:  
![](https://files.catbox.moe/o5gs9i.png)
> Explaination:  
I selected answer C because I thought the conditional blocks were if and else, but they were all if. Answer C is incorrect because in the second if block, if the timer is above 60, the bonus will be assined 1000 instead of 1500 like indended. For the correct answer D, if the answer is 60, it will only meet the conditional for the first if block, if it is between 30-60 it will meet the condition for the second block, and else it will meet conditional for the third block.
### Reflection and What to improve:
- Overall, I think I did pretty well on the quiz, main things I have to work on I think are getting more used to pseudo code, and memorize all of the differences between the internet attacks such as phishing, rogue point, and others. I also need to have broader knowledge of everything such as symmetric encryption which I had no idea about.
