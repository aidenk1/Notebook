# Teamwork last Trimester
- Me and my team worked together throughout the all of tri 2 and I am with 2 of my team members from last trimester in this new class. Before beginning projects, we would brainstorm ideas of projects together and set up plans and expectations we have for each member. If a team member did not complete the work assigned to them by the time we had planned, we would hold them accountable and encourage them to do more coding either in class or at home. We had a discord group chat to discuss outside of school and whatever we could not solve together, we asked for help from our friends with more experience.
