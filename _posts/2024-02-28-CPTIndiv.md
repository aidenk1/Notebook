## My Project
The theme of our CPT Project is geography/travel games. Our project consists of 4 different games that include memory games, trivias, and my flag guessing game. 
## My Features
My specific feature for my project besides the login and signup page is the flag guessing game. Within this game there is a flag list that displays all of the flags in the game, and a leaderboard that stores the users best score in the database.

| Collegeboard Requirements   | How My Work Meets Requirements |
| -------- | ------- |
| 1. Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online data stream, a file.  | 1. The user clicking on the name of the flags to guess the flag is the input |
| 2. Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the users purpose. | 2. SQLite Data Table stores user information and restcountries API is used to manage program complexity because I can use this api to get the flag images and names instead of inputting each individual flag for my game |
| 3. At least one procedure that contributed to the programâ€™s intended purpose where you have defined: the name, return type, one or more parameters. | 3. Log in and sign up page takes JWT tokens and user credentials as parameters |
| 4. An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure.| 4. My flag list function contains all sequencing, selection, and iteration. For sequencing, my code first fitches flag data, then processes and displays the list of flags. For selection, my code includes a sorting algorithm to alphabetically sort the flags. This sorting operation involves making selections based on the comparision of country names. For iteration, the function iterates over each element in the flag data array to generate HTML strings for each flag. |
| 5. Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input and
program functionality | 5. Some outputs are the next questions after the user guesses, their score as they answer the questions, their final score, and the leaderboard.

# PART B: Video
My video meets CPT requirements because it includes the following.
- An input
> User inputs credentials for singing and logging in and user also clicks on flag names to guess the flag
- At least one aspect of the functionality of your program
>User can log and sign up, and the score of the flag game is updated after each question and is displayed at the end. Leaderboard shows users best score. 
- Output Produced by program  
> Program gives login and signup confirmation and displays flag game score throughout the game.
- My video does not have
> No audible narration 
- My video is
> 1 minute long and has captions
