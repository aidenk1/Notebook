## My Project
The theme of our CPT Project is geography/travel games. Our project consists of 4 different games that include memory games, trivias, and my flag guessing game. 
## My Features
For this project, I created the log in page, sign up page, made the log in and sign up function, and created a flag guessing game and a page that displays all of the flags in an alphabetical list.

| Collegeboard Requirements   | How My Work Meets Requirements |
| -------- | ------- |
| 1. Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online data stream, a file.  | 1. User inputs their credentials and clicks on the flags |
| 2. Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the users purpose. | 2. SQLite Data Table stores user information and restcountries API is used to manage program complexity because I can use this api to get the flag images and names instead of inputting each individual flag for my game |
| 3. At least one procedure that contributed to the programâ€™s intended purpose where you have defined: the name, return type, one or more parameters. | 3. Log in and sign up page takes JWT tokens and user credentials as parameters |
| 4. An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure.| 4. My flag list function contains all sequencing, selection, and iteration. For sequencing, my code first fitches flag data, then processes and displays the list of flags. For selection, my code includes a sorting algorithm to alphabetically sort the flags. This sorting operation involves making selections based on the comparision of country names. For iteration, the function iterates over each element in the flag data array to generate HTML strings for each flag. |
| 5. Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input and
program functionality | 5. Some outputs of the project are log in/sign up conformation and failure, score for the flag game, and displaying the list of flags in the game  |

## Somethings I want to Improve before submitting to college board
I want to finish creating the leaderboard for my game so our project will have more database interaction. Also, I want to create a more useful program besides a game that people can use instead of purely just entertainment. For example, an idea I have is creating a travel guide to help people travel new places safely.

# PART B: Video
My video meets CPT requirements because it includes the following.
- An input
> User inputs credentials for singing and logging in and user also clicks on flag names to guess the flag
- At least one aspect of the functionality of your program
>User can log and sign up, and the score of the flag game is updated after each question and is displayed at the end
- Output Produced by program  
> Program gives login and signup confirmation and displays flag game score throughout the game
- My video does not have
> No audible narration 
- My video is
> 1 minute long and has captions
