# Simulations
- abstracitons for more complex objects or phenomena for a specific purpose
- Examples: car testing simulator, flight simulator, RNG
- Simulation abstraction: Artifacts or errors when running a simulation

# Simulations vs Experiments
- Simulations are not in the real world while experiments are
- Simulations provide estimated results
- Simulations are less risky and require less resources

### Algorithmic Efficiency
- Efficiency saves time, energy, and resources.
- Measured by the number of computations.
