# Journey, Learnings, & Discoveries
- Before taking this class I did not know much about coding or computer science so during the summer, a family friend taught me python and a little bit of javascript.
- I read most of the Khan Academy AP CSP lessons and completed a few of the exercises.
- I also learned a lot of what was on the College Board Quiz from the student teachings that we had in our classroom.
- I discovered that I should review college board material and psuedo code frequently because I forgot some of the things that I learned and if I became more proficient in psuedo code I would be able to answer the questions faster.
