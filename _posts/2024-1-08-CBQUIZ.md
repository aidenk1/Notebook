# Journey, Learnings, & Discoveries
- Before taking this class I did not know much about coding or computer science so during the summer, a family friend taught me python and a little bit of javascript.
- I read most of the Khan Academy AP CSP lessons and completed a few of the exercises.
- I also learned a lot of what was on the College Board Quiz from the student teachings that we had in our classroom.
- I discovered that I should review college board material and psuedo code frequently because I forgot some of the things that I learned and if I became more proficient in psuedo code I would be able to answer the questions faster.
# Things to Improve 
- The questions I got incorrect were all topic unit 2 or 3, so I should review those units and study them more before the AP Exam.
- Improve on binary numbers, developing procedures, using programs with data, and conditionals.
# Test Corrections
- Question 21: 
Which of the following code segments will move the robot to the gray square?
Responses
> Answer: MoveXTimes 2, RightXTimes 1, MoveXTimes 3
> Explanation: The first step of the code moves the robot forward 2 squares and the second step rotates the robot 270 degrees to the right so it is facing upwards and the last step moves the robot forward 3 squares so it reaches the gray square.
- Question 26: Which of the following replacements for missing code can be used to move the robot to the gray square?
> Answer:  
IF (CAN_MOVE (right))  
{  
    ROTATE_RIGHT ()
}  
MOVE_FORWARD()  
> Explaination: This code makes the robot rotate right whenever there is an open square to the right. The robot will keep moving forward and then rotating right when there is an open space to its right so the robot will reach the grey square.
- Question 44: A computer program uses 4 bits to represent nonnegative integers. Which of the following statements describe a possible result when the program uses this number representation?
> Answer: The operation 7+10 will result in an overflow error
> Explaination: A 4 bit integer can only represent a value of 0 to 15 and 17 is larger than 15 so it will result in an overflow error.
- Question 60: Which of the following are ways in which a programmer can use abstraction to manage the complexity of a program?
> Answer: Replacing several lines of documentation with a single line of documentation name1, name2, name3, and name 4 with a list of strings called name  
> Explaination: Creating a list of names makes it easier to manage the complexity of a program. This is an example of data abstraction.
