# Journey, Learnings, & Discoveries
- Before taking this class I did not know much about coding or computer science so during the summer, a family friend taught me python and a little bit of javascript.

- I also learned a lot of what was on the College Board Quiz from the student teachings that we had in our classroom.
- I discovered that I should review college board material and psuedo code frequently because I forgot some of the things that I learned and if I became more proficient in psuedo code I would be able to answer the questions faster.
# Things to Improve 
- The questions I got incorrect were all topic unit 2 or 3, so I should review those units and study them more before the AP Exam.
- Improve on binary numbers, developing procedures, using programs with data, and conditionals.
